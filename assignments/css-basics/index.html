            <h3>A Little About Jim</h3>
            <p>James Robert "Jim" Jarmusch was born in 1953 in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. His mother was a film and theater reviewer, and introduced Jarmusch to films when she would leave him at the theater to watch matinee double features while she ran errands. <br>After graduating high school he moved to Chicago, going to journalism school, but upon a lack of completing any work, he left. Jarmusch went on to study literature at Columbia University.

            <h3>Jim's Continued Path</h3>
            <p>Jarmusch then lived in New York City for a while, broke and working as a musician. This is when he followed up on his youth film interest--he went to film graduate school. <br>Jarmusch went on to create classic films, such as his first major film "Stranger Than Paradise," "Down by Law," and "Night on Earth."</p>

            <h3>My Favorite Jarmusch Film</h3>
            <p>One of my personal favorites of his work is the 2003 film "Coffee and Cigarettes." This work is a collection of many different short films, each one a wildly unpredictable match of (fairly famous) actors and/or musicians. The pairs sit and enjoy coffee and cigarettes together, sharing conversation. <br> You see Bill Murray be the waiter to the Wu-Tang Clan, Iggy Pop and Tom Waits annoy each other, you even see Cate Blanchett hangout with herself. Check it out!</p>
